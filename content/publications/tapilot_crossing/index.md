abstract: |
  Conversational Tabular Data Analysis enables real-time data exploration for informed decision-making, but collecting realistic conversational logs is expensive and limits quantitative evaluation of LLMs.
  We introduce Tapilot-Crossing, a benchmark with 1024 conversations across four practical scenarios, constructed via an economical multi-agent environment.
  We further propose Adaptive Conversation Reflection (ACR), which improves LLM agent performance by up to 44.5%.

## What I built
A set of interactive **Tableau dashboards** for:
- **HR analytics** (workforce composition, hiring/termination, salary & tenure)
- **Sales performance** (YoY trends, category performance)
- **Customer analytics** (orders distribution, top customers)

## Data & modeling
- Multi-table analytics structure (e.g., Customers / Orders / Products / Location)
- Parameterized views for year selection and comparisons
- Extensive calculated fields and KPI definitions

## Key metrics (examples)
- Total Active / Total Hired / Total Terminated
- % Hired / % Terminated
- YoY (CY vs PY) Sales / Profit / Orders / Customers
- Sales per Customer
